                  You know the sound; it is a loud booming coming from the laundry
                  room that sounds as if the walls are crashing in around you.
                  Your washer is off balance. But did you know that each time the
                  washer experiences any issue, it damages the unit? Here are a
                  few of the more common repairs we see in the field each day.

                      The washing machine is overfilling with water.{' '}
                    </strong>
                    &nbsp; Flooding in the laundry room is no joke. First, turn
                    off the water to the unit, then call for appliance repair.
                    There are several components we can check for you. It may be
                    the pressure switch, the water inlet valve, the mainboard, and
                    more, causing the overfill.

                    <strong>
                      There is water leaking from my washing machine.
                    </strong>
                    &nbsp; This is one of those problems that can creep up on you
                    and ruin your flooring and more. Front-load washers can dump a
                    lot of water on the floor if they have a problem with the
                    gasket or door locking mechanism. A leaking water supply hose
                    can cause many issues, and clogged drain lines may even be
                    worse. Call a professional for a complete diagnosis right
                    away.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Why won’t my washer drain?</strong>
                    &nbsp; If the washing machine has a problem with the spin
                    cycle, it will not wash or drain. You may have an issue with
                    the door, locks, motor, belts, transmission, clutch, glides,
                    pulley, or drum roller. With that many parts to consider, call
                    for expert diagnosis and repair.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Suds are pouring out of my washer.</strong>
                    &nbsp; Over-sudsing can cause a variety of problems, from the
                    classic image of a mountain of froth running out of your
                    washer to leftover suds that stick to your clothes and the
                    inside of the washing machine’s drum after a cycle. Try
                    reducing the detergent you use, and have the drain and pump
                    checked by a professional.

                  <li>
                    <strong>What is wrong? It won’t turn on at all.</strong>
                    &nbsp; Of course, the first thing to check is that the plug
                    has not come loose from the outlet. After that, there could be
                    several other reasons your washing machine won’t turn on. It
                    could be a problem with the electric or motor board, which are
                    simple replacements.
