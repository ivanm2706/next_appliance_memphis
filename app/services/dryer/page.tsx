                    </strong>
                    &nbsp; Blocked vents from lint build-up can cause the wet air
                    to be trapped in the unit. When the condensation has nowhere
                    to go, your clothes will not dry. And the blocked vents can
                    eventually lead to dryer fires.

                    </strong>
                    &nbsp; A machine that is no longer level can cause the dryer
                    to seem to move. And this can be a real problem, as it can
                    snap the electrical and condensate lines. Call to get the
                    dryer balanced and keep it in its place.

                    &nbsp; If it is still plugged in and the door latches, there
                    may be an electrical problem causing the machine not to turn
